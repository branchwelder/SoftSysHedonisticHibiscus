# Lá Trop
## 2D Portal with C++ and GLUT
### Hannah Twigg-Smith, Philip Seger, and Sam Myers

## Big Idea
Là Trop is a two-dimensional, Portal-inspired platformer created in C++ and OpenGL. The player can place two portals which teleport them to the other location on contact. The game world is viewed from the side, and the player is affected by gravity, obstacles, and enemies. They must teleport around to complete levels.

## Background
The main goal of this project was to develop a game in C++ using OpenGL to render sprites and graphics. The finished game consists of player movement from a two-dimensional, side-view perspective. This project was motivated by the team's collective interest in game development and the possibility of learning a new language (C++). Because the goal of this project was to explore the many components of game development, we emphasized this over finalizing a game. Our final project is functional, but not very interesting to a player (we don't have any puzzles to solve). If this project was to continue, we would focus on creating an executable that would be playable from start to finish, but ultimately that was beyond the scope of this project.


### Resources
- [Lighthouse3D Tutorials](http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glut-tutorial/) has a large number of OpenGL/GLUT tutorials that were invaluable to us when we were creating our initial environment
- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/) was our go-to C++ reference that helped us get started with the language
- [The Simple OpenGL Image Library](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) was the library we settled on to assist us with loading images and textures, and the documentation provided some examples on how to do that
- [The OpenGL Documentation](https://www.opengl.org/) was frequently visited as we were trying to understand OpenGL's plethora of functions
- [The Xcode documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/) was also useful during our experience with Xcode

We didn't use anything significant aside from these resources, as much of our development process was trial and error. As usual, we used Google, StackOverflow, and the OpenGL forums to answer many of our one-off questions during development.

## Implementation
We created a scrum-style [sprint plan](https://github.com/hannahtwiggsmith/SoftSysHedonisticHibiscus/projects/1) that can be viewed on GitHub projects. We organized our work using this system instead of Trello because it is fairly new and we wanted to try it out. We separated our work into one-week sprints and created issues for the work we wanted to get done each week, as well as some stretch goals:

**Project goals:**
- ~~Object collision~~ Done!
- ~~User input~~ Done!
- ~~Basic OpenGL rendering~~ Done!
- ~~Model/View/Controller scaffolding~~ Done!
- ~~Reading a level from a text file~~ Done!
- Enemies

**Stretch goals:**
- ~~Textures~~ Done!
- ~~Physics engine (jumping/gravity)~~ Done!
- Portals

We wanted to explore video game development from a lower level instead of using existing frameworks/engines (like Unity or Unreal) to get a better feel for how everything was supposed to work together and to learn more about OpenGL. As such, we decided to use some older technology (specifically GLUT, which was last updated in 1998). This meant we had to learn about frame buffers and the logic behind rendering, as well as polygons and textures, without "cheating" by using a framework that easily rendered objects for us. Much of the guidance for this was found at [this tutorial](http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glut-tutorial/) and through trial and error, due to the surprising lack of resources on the internet around this topic. The initial setup of the game environment was quite a challenge using GLUT, but once we had a functioning Model/View/Controller (MVC), it was easy to build off the component parts to complete our goals. The initial physics engine was a contained a lot of "rough" math and we built on it in a similar fashion.

### Player Movement
Player movement is done with via user input (the A and D keys), while jumping is accomplished with W. Q and E fire portals. If a Q- or E-portal already exists on the map, pressing Q or E again will update its position. The logic for this exists in our controller file.

### Level Generation
Levels are stored as .txt files and can be edited by the end user to create custom and unique maps. In these files, 0s represent blank space, while 1s represent a block. Our game window is currently set to 64x48 10-pixel blocks, which corresponds to a 640x480 pixel window.

### OpenGL Graphics and Textures
The largest focus for this project was to explore OpenGL and GLUT, which are rendering systems that are available for many languages (our focus was C++). With GLUT/OpenGL, the GLUT main loop takes over the program when it is called (using `glutMainLoop()`) and handles frame redraws and updates. Each time through the loop, the model is updated and the view is rendered to reflect those updates.

GLUT caused us some initial trouble. For example, once the GLUT main loop takes control, printing to std::cout is blocked (as the main glut loop never returns) which prevents us from debugging with print statements. Before we realized this, we thought everything was broken because our debug messages were never displaying in the consols. 

One of the main resources we worked with was SOIL (the Simple OpenGL Image Library) in OpenGL. SOIL is much more straightforward than the "pure" OpenGL way of rendering textures, which made our lives considerably easier (~25 lines of code with SOIL vs. ~300 lines with pure OpenGL). This meant that we could load a texture and render it with this function:

```cpp
_tex = SOIL_load_OGL_texture
    (
     "doge.jpg",
     SOIL_LOAD_AUTO,
     SOIL_CREATE_NEW_ID,
     SOIL_FLAG_MIPMAPS | SOIL_FLAG_INVERT_Y | SOIL_FLAG_NTSC_SAFE_RGB | SOIL_FLAG_COMPRESS_TO_DXT
     );
```

Every time the model was updated, everything (the player, environment blocks, and enemies) was redrawn with this code, which binds the texture to a polygon and draws it at the `_x` and `_y` coordinates:

```cpp
// Enable 2D textures
glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);

// Bind texture to the texture target (GL_TEXTURE_2D)
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, _tex);

// Create a coord and bind it to the vertex
glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
glColor3f(255,255,255);
glTexCoord2f(0,0);
glVertex2f(_x,_y);
glTexCoord2f(1,0);
glVertex2f(_x+1, _y);
glTexCoord2f(1,1);
glVertex2f(_x+1, _y+1);
glTexCoord2f(0,1);
glVertex2f(_x, _y+1);
glEnd();
```

### Physics Engine
Instead of handling player movement as a discrete number of blocks per keypress, we switched to players having acceleration and velocities, making movement seem a little more fluid. The way we process keypresses now sets the velocity of a player, as shown below:
```cpp
void Model::_processKeys() {
    if (_keyStates['a'] && !_keyStates['d']) {
        _player.setActiveVelocity(-PLAYER_SPEED, 0.0f);
    } else if (_keyStates['d'] && !_keyStates['a']) {
        _player.setActiveVelocity(PLAYER_SPEED, 0.0f);
    } else {
        _player.setActiveVelocity(0.0f, 0.0f);
    }
}
```

We process gravity if there is no block underneath the player. This is a meaty function, but the big takeaways are that there is a dy/dt multiplier for gravity, and this affects the player no matter where they are, unless they are on the bottom of the map or intersecting with another block.

```cpp
void Model::_handlePhysics(float dt) {
    float dydt = GRAVITY * (dt / 1000.0f);
    double dx = _player.getVelocity().first * (dt / 1000.0f);
    double dy = (_player.getVelocity().second + dydt) * (dt / 1000.0f);
    Position newPosition = Position(
        _player.getPosition().first + dx,
        _player.getPosition().second + dy
    );

    bool xCollision = false;
    bool yCollision = false;
    for (auto it : _world) {
        int collision = _checkCollision(it.first, newPosition);
        if (collision == 1 && !xCollision) {
            xCollision = true;
            dx += _handleCollision(newPosition.first, it.first.first);
        }
        if (collision == 2 && !yCollision) {
            yCollision = true;
            dy += _handleCollision(newPosition.second, it.first.second);
        }
        if (xCollision && yCollision) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (yCollision) {
        if (!_player.onGround) {
            _player.onGround = true;
            _player.resetPassiveVelocity();
        }
    } else {
        if (_player.onGround) {
            _player.onGround = false;
        }
        _player.changePassiveVelocity(0.0f, dydt);
    }

    _movePlayer(dx, dy);
}
```

### Developing in Xcode
Every member of the team had a Mac and no experience working with Xcode, so we decided to use Xcode as our development environment. We created the entirety of the project in the environment, using the command line as little as possible to fully immerse ourselves. Although we learned quite a bit about linking libraries and managing a large project with Xcode, we have ultimately decided that the trouble it caused us wasn't worth the effort. While it was easy to compile and run the game using the builtin functionality, it also meant that we did not have a way to build for other environments as easily. We also experienced a serious merge conflict within the Xcode project configuration settings at a critical point in implementation that took us multiple hours to resolve. In general, local C++ development with Xcode was fairly straightforward and very nice for building a test package without much extra thought (just use CMD+r), but if we were going to use it again in the future we would better research the intricacies of collborating with it using version control.

### Exploring C++
For this project, we switched from C to C++, mainly because we wanted to gain experience with a new language and C++'s object-oriented features are much better suited for game development than pure C. This allowed us to organize our files into the Model-View-Controller structure that is standard for game programming. We used public and private values and functions to more conveniently organize code.
