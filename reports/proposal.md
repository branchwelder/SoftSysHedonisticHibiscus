### Project goals
The main goal of this project is to learn and develop a game in C++, most likely using OpenGL to render sprites and graphics. The game will consist of player movement from a top-down perspective. As well, an interesting mechanic we plan on building the game off of is using “portals” to teleport the player to different locations. Stretch goals can include making it multiplayer, more advanced graphical animations, and/or possibly more complex teleportation movement. 

### Background research and initial resources
Some of the background research we have started includes looking into C++ and OpenGL. We were initially planning on splitting logic into C and graphics into C++, however considering game design being more convenient in object-oriented style (as well as graphics), we will likely do a project completely in C++. Some of our reading to start includes [casual background reading on how to make a game](https://tfetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/0735714347_Creating_Games_in_C-_A_Step-by-Step_Guide.pdf), some [game programming in C](http://www.cprogramming.com/game-programming.html) concepts, and rendering [sprites](https://learnopengl.com/#!In-Practice/2D-Game/Rendering-Sprites) in our program. We were thinking that our game would consist of the player (rendered as a sprite), able to move around and have the camera locked on them from a top view. Enemies/obstacles are probably also going to be rendered as sprites. The interesting bit will be the logic for “teleporting” a character to a different position once they step on the “portals” that they can place. This will make the game more complex as well in the sense of problem solving/maze-like logic.

### Sprint backlog
Initial backlog found here: [Backlog](https://trello.com/b/s5StvdZQ/softsyshedonistichibiscus). As well, our team will likely be running in one week sprints to stay productive and continue development at a more efficient pace.

### Potential roadblocks
OpenGL in general might pose some complexity to the project. As well, if we start working with multiplayer, that can be super complex. C++ might have some initial learning curve, however once we pass that we should be okay.
